# Minecraft Progression Scheduler

This is some python script I made to start a Minecraft 'progression' server.

What does this script do?
* Start at Minecraft 1.0
* Auto update on a custom schedule set in settings.json
* Goes up to version 1.21.10

## Setup

* Rename `properties.example.json` -> `properties.json`.
  * Modify to your liking
* Rename `settings.example.json` -> `settings.json`.
  * Modify to your liking

Run `python3 server.py`
